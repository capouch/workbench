What's the ===Sequential Search business p. 192?

dispArray and sequentialSearch aren't "code" font.

In this chapter (maybe for the first time?) his various iterations
of the code live in "example-numbered" files.

Example code on p. 200 doesn't have an "example number"

Exs 13-14 and 13-15 are the same, just he includes the kitchen
sink in 15, which files are already in their own files.  

So 13-15 is pretty much useless.
