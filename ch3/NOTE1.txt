Note that find() and remove() are swapped in the text

Also in List.js length is defined twice in the constructor

p.42 one part of test code uses print; the other uses console.log

p.44 file-reading code isn't properly rendered 

p.45 More code not showing as code (var customers. . )

p. 46 what is all that red text doing?
